0MQ version 2.2.0 (beta), released on 2011/04/xx
================================================

Bug fixes
---------

Changes
-------

* Duplicate identities now checked at connection time. A peer using a 
  duplicate identity is disconnected and will retry after the 
  ZMQ_RECONNECT_IVL, with backoff strategy.
  
* System error reporting bus, sys://log introduced.

* Duplicate identities are logged to sys://log.

* ZMQ_MAXMSGSIZE socket option added. This allows the node to guard 
  against peers sending oversized messages. If a peer sends an oversized
  message, the connection to that peer is dropped.
